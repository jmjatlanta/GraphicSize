GraphicSize
===========

Simple C++ code to retrieve image dimensions from JPEG, GIF, or PNG files.

This code was taken from an old post on CPlusPlus.com (http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/45217/). I have modified it to get it working and use it in my own works.

I am unable to reach the original poster, so licensing may be an issue. Use at your own risk.

This is very much alpha code. Please feel free to contact me with any problems.

The only necessary file is GraphicSize.cpp. The rest is for testing and building. There are no dependancies beyond your standard compiler libraries.
